# AdventureWorks Cycles - Business Intelligence Project

## Overview
This project simulates the role of a **Business Intelligence Analyst** for **AdventureWorks Cycles**, a fictional manufacturing company. The goal of the project was to transform raw dto insightful, professional-quality reports and interactive dashboards that track key performance indicators (KPIs), analyze regional performance, monitor product-level trends, and identify high-value customers.

Throughout the project, I applied best practices in **data preparation**, **data modeling**, **advanced analysis using DAX**, and **data visualization** to deliver actionable business insights for decision-makers. The project involves building an end-to-end BI solution using **Power BI**.

## Technologies Usedata in
- **Power BI Desktop**
- **Power Query Editor**
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**
- **SQL (for data extraction)**
- **Excel (for data modeling)**

## Key Features
- **Data Preparation**: Extracted, cleaned, and transformed raw data using Power Query.
- **Data Modeling**: Built a relational data model with fact and dimension tables, relationships, and hierarchies.
- **Advanced DAX Measures**: Created calculated fields using DAX functions such as `CALCULATE`, `FILTER`, and time intelligence patterns to derive business insights.
- **Dashboard & Reports**: Designed interactive dashboards with KPIs, trend charts, maps, and slicers for in-depth analysis of sales, product performance, and regional trends.

## Files in This Repository
- `AdventureWorks_Cycles.pbix`: Main Power BI project file containing all the reports and dashboards.
- `Sales_Data.xlsx`: Sample sales data used for analysis and modeling.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## How to Use
### Power BI
1. **Download the `AdventureWorks_Cycles.pbix` file**.
2. **Open it in Power BI Desktop**.
3. Explore the interactive dashboards that provide insights into:
   - Total sales revenue and key product trends.
   - Regional performance across different geographies.
   - Customer segmentation and high-value customers.

### Data Insights:
- The dashboard presents KPIs for sales performance, product analysis, and customer segmentation.
- The reports allow you to drill down into specific regions, products, or customers to uncover hidden insights.

## Insights & Analysis
- **Sales Performance**: The dashboard highlights overall sales performance, allowing users to quickly assess total revenue and monitor sales trends.
- **Product-Level Trends**: The analysis identifies top-performing products by revenue, helping the company prioritize inventory and marketing strategies.
- **Regional Insights**: The project includes regional performance comparison, making it easy to identify areas with high growth potential.
- **Customer Segmentation**: By analyzing high-value customers, the company can tailor marketing efforts and improve customer retention.

## Data Modeling Techniques
- **Relational Model**: Created a star schema with fact and dimension tables, ensuring an optimized and efficient data model.
- **DAX Calculations**: Developed complex DAX measures to compute dynamic KPIs and time-based metrics like Year-to-Date (YTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) growth.

## About the Project Workflow
This project followed the key stages of the **Business Intelligence (BI) workflow**:

1. **Connecting & Shaping Data**:
   - Utilized **Power Query** to clean and transform raw data.
   - Created custom columns, merged queries, and grouped data to prepare it for analysis.

2. **Creating a Relational Data Model**:
   - Built a **star schema** with fact and dimension tables.
   - Defined relationships and hierarchies for effective analysis and reporting.

3. **Adding Calculated Fields with DAX**:
   - Used **DAX** to create measures and calculated columns, enabling the generation of dynamic KPIs and advanced analytics.
   - Applied time intelligence functions for analysis across different time periods.

4. **Visualizing Data with Reports**:
   - Designed interactive and user-friendly dashboards, including KPI cards, trend charts, and geographical maps.
   - Incorporated slicers, drill-through, and drill-down features for in-depth exploration.
